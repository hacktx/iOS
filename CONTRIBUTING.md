# How to contribute
This document will outline how to contribute to the further development of the HackTX iOS. While this app has been specifically designed for use at HackTX, it can easily be adapted for use by any hackathon, so we appreciate any contributions to help us further our support back to the community. We have a few guidelines that we need contributors from the community to follow in order to keep things running smoothly.

## Getting Started

Fork then clone the repo replacing `your_username` with your actual GitHub username

    git clone git@github.com:your_username/iOS-HackTX-2015.git


## Making Changes

1. Create a branch with an appropriate name
  1. Branch off from where you want to base your work (usually the master branch)
  2. Please don't target release branches
  3. Do not work directly on master. If you submit a pull request directly on the master branch it will be closed.
2. Make your commits in logical units. There should not be tiny changes in all commits, nor should all your work be condensed in one commit.
3. Make sure you continue to follow the whitespace formatting. Remove extraneous whitespace using `git diff --check`

## Submitting Changes
Once you have pushed all changes to your fork, you can submit a pull request to the HackTX repo. A member from the HackTX iOS team will review your changes. If it all looks good, we'll merge it, otherwise we'll make suggestions how to fix it.
